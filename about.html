            <h2>Hello, I'm Collin</h2>
            <p>I was indoctrinated into the world of sports at the youngest age possible. One of the first shirts I've
                ever worn bore the iconic Giants' NY across the front. I grew up engrossed in sport, watching and
                listening to events with my father for my entire childhood, which made sports my favorite topic to speak
                about. My life has built an immense passion for sport, one that I like nothing more than to share with
                as many people as I can. If I am able to use my platform to foster the same love for athletics that was
                granted to me by the sportscasters of my time, then I will consider myself successful.</p>

        <div class="section" id="Experience">
            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>I am a junior at the University of Pittsburgh, studying to receive a BA in Media and Professional
                Communications, as well as certificates in TV and Broadcast Arts and Sports Studies.</p>

            <p>Originally from Weston, Connecticut, I've served as the lead host for KDKA Radio's Next Take, the first
                ever commercial radio show hosted by college students. I am also currently a host on WPTS Radio's weekly
                sports show Friday Fanatics, and serve as a play by play announcer for the station as well, responsible
                for covering University of Pittsburgh athletics. I've previously worked as the Alumni Spotlight
                producer, digital content producer, and audio producer for Pitt to the Point, the University of
                Pittsburgh's first hour-long newscast. I've previously written sports articles for WPTS Radio as recaps
                of sporting events I had previously covered. I am also a former martial arts instructor for Legacy
                Martial Arts in Westport Connecticut.</p>

            <p>I pride myself in my positive energy and excitement as an announcer, as well as a remarkably strong work
                ethic. My work has been broadcast on an international stage through KDKA Radio and Audacy Radio. When in
                my free time, I enjoy watching various sporting events, namely football, baseball, and mixed martial
                arts, as well as spending time with friends and family and continuing to hone my own martial arts
                skills.</p>

            <p>I consider myself remarkably fortunate to provide both sports and news coverage and entertainment with
                the Pittsburgh community and beyond.</p>
